# Eigenfaces

This script uses principal component analysis on the cropped version of the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset (LFWcrop) to generate the 'eigenfaces' of the dataset and use them to reconstruct and classify faces in the dataset. This is accomplished by running the singular value decomposition algorithm in Matlab (svd) to generate the principal components (i.e. 'eigenfaces')

Here is a sample of 16 faces from the dataset:
